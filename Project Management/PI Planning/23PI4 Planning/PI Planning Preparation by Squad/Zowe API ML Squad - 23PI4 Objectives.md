# Zowe API ML Squad - 23PI4 Objectives  
(October 2023 to January 2024)

## Spring Boot 3 & Java 17 Support

Ensure we support Java 17 in the API ML and support Spring Boot 3 on the API ML for Zowe V3.

Impact on other Zowe components: POSSIBLE

API ML Squad Plan:
- [Spring Boot 3 and Java 17](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3113) 
- [As modern sysprog, i want to have confidence that API ML will run on my Java17 system.](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2891)
- [Upgrade Spring Boot to 3.1 (Zowe V3)](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2959)
- [As an extender I want to have Spring enabler supporting Version 3 of Spring](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/3114)

## V3 Build Spring Cloud Gateway as a replacement for the current Gateway #2029

Spring Cloud Zuul is in maintenance mode and not actively developed anymore. Spring Cloud has moved away from the Netflix Zuul OSS and will deprecate it at some point. The official replacement in the Spring Cloud ecosystem is the Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG). On completion of this Epic, the SCG application that will start properly and be able to take responsibility for the current API Gateway with respect to routing and authentication. The intention is for the SCG to fully replace the existing gateway with the release of V3.

# Stretch

## Improve logging for the API ML #1796

Zowe will enhance the support experience of Zowe with the aim to reduce the number of support cases opened. Where cases are opened this objective will reduce time taken to identify defects' root causes and more quickly address configuration problems.  

- if there is no issue, we should log only that the services started, ideally including a point when the whole Zowe is started and works properly. 
- if there are issues that limit the functionality but don't break things, we need to log them as warnings in a way that's actionable by the users.  
- if there are issues preventing Zowe from working, these will be logged as errors with easy to find error codes and actionable text.  
- Logs created for debugging should go to files instead of the spool so that the diagnostics pax contains them.  
- Debugging logs should contain, by default, the details of the TLS communication.

Impact on other Zowe components: NONE
