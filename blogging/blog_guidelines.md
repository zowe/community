### Tracking of the blog pipeline and publication progress

- The pipeline of blogs for the [Zowe Medium Blog Site](https://medium.com/zowe) is available for viewing on a publicly accessible [KanBan board](https://github.com/orgs/openmainframeproject/projects/4).  This allows anyone to see what articles are being worked on by others prior to publication, and also for a blog author it let you see the status of your blog being edited as well as the assigned reviewers.  

## Blog preparation

**Blogs should:**

 - Be brief (generally < 1200; > 500 words)
 - Focus on a target audience
 - Be relevant
   - The title and first paragraph should compel the viewer to take the time to read the piece.  The content should be relevant and helpful for the target audience.
 - Leverage visuals (screenshots, GIFs, etc.), especially an eye-catching featured image  
   - See public, license-free sites like unsplash.com

**Discoverability (search results):**

 - Determine which Google search keywords are best suited for your content and target audience (i.e., what are you communicating and to whom?  What keywords are they likely to use?).  Include these keywords in your title and related words in the body, especially the first paragraph.

 - Be sure your title, opening paragraph (and featured image) will stand out in a search by your target audience (i.e., will it get people to click your entry over all the other Google results?)

## Publishing steps

 - Create a Medium handle.  
 - Let [zowe-blog-editors@openmainframeproject.org](email:zowe-blog-editors@openmainframeproject.org) know your handle so you can be added as a “writer” for the publication.  To see your handle, select your profile picture when you log into medium.com, it will begin with an `@` symbol, e.g. `@myusername_1974.  

### When ready to write

 - Go to the Zowe blog [KanBan board](https://github.com/orgs/openmainframeproject/projects/4) to see what other blogs are being worked on in case there is a blog already being authored/prepared on the same topic.  See also [Tracking of blogs](#tracking-of-the-blog-pipeline-and-publication-progress)
 - Go to [Medium.com](https://medium.com)
 - Click your profile (should be logged in)
 - Click New Story

### Writing your blog

 - Begin editing
 - If needed, save as “draft”
 - Include the following sentences at the end of your blog, shown below as it should appear.  
 - "If you enjoyed this blog checkout more [Zowe blogs here](https://medium.com/zowe). Or, ask a question and join the conversation on the [Open Mainframe Project Slack Channel](https://openmainframeproeject.slack.org) #Zowe-dev, #Zowe-user or #Zowe-onboarding. If this is your first time using the OMP slack channel register [here](https://slack.openmainframeproject.org)."
   ```
   Raw markdown for the slack channel paragraph:
   
   If you enjoyed this blog checkout more [Zowe blogs here](https://medium.com/zowe). Or, ask a question and join the conversation on the [Open Mainframe Project Slack Channel](https://openmainframeproeject.slack.org) #Zowe-dev, #Zowe-user or #Zowe-onboarding. If this is your first time using the OMP slack channel register [here](https://slack.openmainframeproject.org).
   ```

**Please do not publish your own post.**

### Include OMP Branding

 - At the first mention of Zowe use the branding phrase `Open Mainframe Project's Zowe`  with hyperlinks to https://www.openmainframeproject.org/ and https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/zowe.  An example of this is the sentence below as it should appear in the blog.
 - "This blog describes how to obtain and install The [Open Mainfranme Project's](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) [Zowe](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/zowe) command line interface."
   ```
   Raw markdown for the OMP branding example:
   
   This blog describes how to obtain and install The [Open Mainfranme Project's](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) [Zowe](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/zowe) command line interface.  
   ```

**Please do not publish your own post.**

### When ready to publish

 - You may need to add the publication to your profile (Profile => Publication => New Publication)
 - Double check: be sure you have...
   - compelling title and opening paragraph (discoverability is critical!)
   - featured image and visuals in place.  By default, the first image will be associated with the blog post, however you can choose to use a different headline image by navigating to the image while in edit mode, select it manually, and press `Shift + F`. 
   - appropriate links and tags
 - Include 4 tags like: `Zowe`, `Mainframe`, `DevOps`, `Open Source`, [specific technology like `COBOL`, `VSCode`], [specific roles like `Sysprog`], etc.  There are 5 tags allowed per article, and one of them must be used to categorize the blog as `Zowecore`, `Zoweincubation` or `Zoweecosystem`.  See [Zowe Core](#zowe-core), [Zowe Ecosystem](#zowe-ecosytstem), and [Zowe Incubation](#zowe-incubation).

 ## Content guidelines

 As a blog writer you can write about any topic that you're interested in and that will provide value to the Zowe community.  The content on our blog consists of:

 - Articles about core Zowe projects, Zowe incubation projects, or Zowe conformant offerings
 - Technical content and how-to's
 - Stories about Zowe deployments
 - Use cases and success stories
 - Reports from Zowe events

 Other topics are welcome, but it needs to have a direct link to the Zowe community
 
 Blogs fall into one of three categories and are differentiated to avoid a user visiting a Zowe blogsite from misunderstanding the relationship between whether the content being described is free open source software included with a Long Term Support (LTS) Zowe release, a commercial vendor Zowe offerings, or a project in its incubation phase.

 - [Zowe Core](#zowe-core)
 - [Zowe Ecosystem](#zowe-ecosystem)
 - [Zowe Incubation](#zowe-incubation)

 
### Zowe Core
 
 These articles reference content that is owned and managed by the Open Mainframe Project residing as source code in [https://github.com/zowe](https://github.com/zowe) repositories.  Core Zowe content is available for a user to download on [https://www.zowe.org/#download](https://www.zowe.org/#download) as well as the Visual Studio Marketplace plugin [Zowe Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe).

 Core Zowe articles may also reference other open source technologies such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), and other products available under OSI approved licenses.

 Posts are be vendor-neutral, although the author is allowed to describe their bio in relation to their role at a commercial company, (e.g. Janet is lead systems programmer at mainframewidgets.com), including links to social media handles.

 Core Zowe articles are published on [https://medium.com/zowe](https://medium.com/zowe).

 Blogs that meet the criteria for Core Zowe should have the word [`{Core}`](https://github.com/zowe/community/blogging/blog_guidelines.html#zowe-core) as the first word of the first sentence of the article which should be a hyperlink to the URL https://github.com/zowe/community/blogging/blog_guidelines.html#zowe-core.  This allows a reader to easily see that the content relates to core Zowe functionality. 

 An example of a Zowe core blog is [Installing Zowe on z/OS](https://medium.com/zowe/installing-zowe-on-z-os-de69ec5412ff) that discussed how to install, configure and launch a Zowe convenience build.  

### Zowe ecosystem

Zowe is a tooling platform which includes a number of frameworks allowing it to be extended by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) or System Integrators (SIs). Offerings that are proven to meet the acceptance criteria for interoperating with Zowe are awarded a Zowe conformance badge, see [Zowe conformance](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/projects/zowe/conformance).

Articles written about the Zowe ecosystem are welcome as they show the diversity of the platform and the capabilities a mainframe user can enjoy when using Zowe alongside one or more of its conformant products.

The post may mention a vendor's name as it relates to Zowe, project deployments, adoption paths, their hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event including virtual events, indications of meaningful participation in the community, but it shouldn't feel like an advertisement for services of your company.  

Content that discusses a vendor's commercial offering should be in relation to Zowe. Discussion of the commercial offering should be valuable to set the scene for the technical offering and its usage in relation to being exploited through use of the Zowe conformant scenarios.  Relevant descriptions of vendor technology with hyperlinks to further material hosted on other sites, including how a reader can find out more about the commercial offering, are encouraged as long as they do not become an advertisement. It is encouraged that the linked to sites hosted by companies for readers to find out more information on the vendor offering mention Zowe with correct trademark attribution.  

Zowe ecosystem blogs should have the word [`{Ecosystem}`](https://github.com/zowe/community/blogging/blog_guidelines.html#zowe-ecosystem) as the first word of the first sentence of the article that hyperlinks to the URL https://github.com/zowe/community/blogging/blog_guidelines.html#zowe-ecosystem. 

Zowe conformance logos can be found at https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork/tree/master/other/zowe-conformant.

An example of a blog about the Zowe Ecosystem is [Setting up CA Endeavor for Zowe CLI](https://medium.com/zowe/setting-up-ca-endevor-for-zowe-cli-d8833a8312ee).  This discusses the Computer Associates Endeavor source code management tool in relation to having a Zowe CLI that is a Zowe conformant offering.  Discussion of Endavor is included with links for CA hosted sites, and the author has focused on the value and knowledge required to learn, install, and operate the CA Endeavor Zowe CLI bridge plugin.  

### Zowe incubation

Zowe provides for projects to be in incubation that may not be currently in core Zowe.  There is value in promoting and sharing these projects with the Zowe community and articles written about technology in the incubation phase are welcome to be written about in the Zowe blogsite.  The definition of a Zowe incubation project is mediated by the Zowe Leadership Committee (ZLC).

A reader of the Zowe blogsite should be able to recognize that the content relates to a Zowe incubation project that may be outside of the core Zowe Long Term Support (LTS).  Incubation blogs should have the word [`{Incubation}`](https://github.com/zowe/community/blogging/blog_guidelines.html#zowe-incubation) as the first word of the first sentence of the article that hyperlinks to the URL https://github.com/zowe/community/blogging/blog_guidelines.html#zowe-incubation.  

## Personas
 
 The Zowe community is made up of a number of different personas

 - **Users**.  
   - Mainframers who are using Zowe technology, covering its components Zowe Explorer, Zowe desktop, API Mediation Layer or Command Line Interface.  This includes developers, system programmers, devops pipeline engineers, ...
 - **Administrators**.  
   - Mainframers who are concerned with installing, configuring, tuning, managing Zowe distributions on behalf of users.
 - **Architects**.  
   - Software architects interested in articles that cover broad topics relates to positioning Zowe rather than end user articles.  Architectural blogs will likely have a higher content of diagrams and background, whereas a user article might have more screen shots and hands on code-snippets.

To help blog readers navigate between posts for different personas, there are specific sections titled `For Users`, `For Administrators` and `For Architects`.  The persona will be applied by the editors reviewing and accepting the blog content, although a writer may indicate when they submit a blogpost which persona they have in mind their audience.

## Promotion

Your blog will be shared on the Open Mainframe Project's [twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenMFProject) and [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-open-mainframe-project/) channels.
