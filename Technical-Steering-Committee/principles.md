# Principles

The aim of this document is to collect important values from the Zowe community and to help us identify the right direction for the project. When we state we will do something it means to the best of our knowledge and none of the statements should be perceived as a valid reason for a legal action against Zowe. 


Zowe is a project that aims to bring modern interfaces - API, command line, and visual – to z/OS via an open source community. In case of disagreement within the Zowe community, the principles outlined here need to be taken into account when mediating.


## Transparent and open implementation, processes and deliveries
**Principle:** Open first

We will plan and develop transparently and in open. We will build an inclusive environment where anyone willing can easily find a way to participate and contribute. 

## Zowe does not compromise on mainframe security standards
**Principle:** Security is paramount

We commit to secure development practices. We'll follow/comply/adhere to/obey with /conform to cybersecurity regulations requirements. We will strive to never introduce a feature or change that circumvents or allows circumvention of z/OS security infrastructure. We will regularly/continuously perform vulnerability testing of the Zowe project source code and any used third party libraries. If vulnerabilities are found they will be resolved with fix or workaround will be provided.

## Zowe provides modern interfaces to access and exploit mainframe
**Principle:** Modern and effective interfaces

We will provide the foundations and tools for all the vendors existing within the ecosystem to easily interface to and develop more interfaces to z/OS. The tools should be simple, effective, actively used and developed. The users should be able to leverage the provided tools and interfaces to get more value out of their mainframe environments. Examples domains for such tools and interfaces include web, mobile, APIs (C interfaces to HLASM, other programming interfaces, REST APIs, ...) and modern Developer Environments.

## Collaboration between mainframe and other platforms - both mainframe and distributed - benefits both sides
**Principle:** Hybrid

We will bring lessons from the non-mainframe world to the mainframe platform as well as providing the opportunity for the non-mainframe world to benefit from the knowledge gained in the mainframe world in order to build secure and performant hybrid environments in which mainframe plays core role. To do so we intend to lower the entry barrier to the mainframe environment by leveraging the technologies famililar to modern developers and supporting mainframe education.

## We will listen to our stakeholders and elicit feedback from them.
**Principle**: Stakeholder-centric

We are stakeholder-centric project where stakeholders include end-users, exploiters, deploying enterprises or the Zowe Advisory Council. We will keep the best interests of our stakeholders in mind and elicit feedback from them as much as possible, incorporate feedback when planning future work, and keep our stakeholders informed on Zowe's evolution and how their feedback is received and responded to.

## The Zowe does not depend on and is not owned by any specific Vendor
**Principle:** Vendor Neutral

We will keep Zowe vendor neutral. No company can claim that it owns Zowe. If we use technology owned by a vendor or company (e.g. z/OS) we need a very strong argument and a means to move away from that technology if the vendor intends to leverage the technology counter to our principles. Such technology also needs to be accessible to anyone wanting to participate and contribute to the Zowe project. 

## Squads are self-governing
**Principle:** Minimal Viable Governance

We build only minimum necessary policies and governance and let the squads deliver the value in a way that fits them without endangering the whole project.

## Decision made within the project are based on community feedback supported by objective data
** Principle:** Learning and data driven

We believe in development responding to change, done in collaboration with customers, always producing working software where individual and interactions are valued. We are also data-driven with respect to quality and performance metrics.
