                2. Extend test cycle time frame / release window (after release candidate is created) from 3-biz days to 6-biz days with a goal to understand where the testing challenges lie
            1. **Option 2: Extend release window**
                1. Consider changing cadence to 1 release every 2 months with a goal to get back to 1 release every 1 month
