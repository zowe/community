# Zowe Community statement on Support

Zowe is an Open Source project that's being driven by the community. As such any effort provided by the community in on best-effort basis.
If you need a support with SLA's please consult our list of [Conformant Support Providers](https://openmainframeproject.org/our-projects/zowe-conformant-support-provider-program/)

## Validating pre-requisities

The Zowe community has access only to limited set of hardware. This limits our capacity to run automated test suites. We keep the list of the pre-requisites that
Zowe is tested on in [Zowe docs](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/blob/tsc/support/matrix/docs/user-guide/systemrequirements-zos.md)

## Out of support prerequisites

For the pre-requisites that end their support Zowe doesn't guarantee any support for running. E.g. Zowe doesn't have to support z/OS 2.2 as it's already out of support. 
As such changes that break support for such version aren't considered as breaking change.
