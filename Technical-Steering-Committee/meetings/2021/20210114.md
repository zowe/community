1. TSC Charter

[TSC Chater proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UN72RujWpmIVwtGuv0PyrRs-qygVQsyILuLyKFmE4Ho/edit?usp=sharing).

Discussion around
- Removal of a committer.  Is 50% of committers to approve the right number ? 
- What makes up a committer.  This is not included in the charter as it is more changeable, tracked in [Git issue](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/922).
- Can a vote be challenged/contested ?  
  - John let us know that in his 5 years LF experience, very few votes have ever not been unanimous 
  **Action Item** Bruce Armstrong to bring up at ZLC whether it has oversight on TSC decisions/appeals
- Policies
  - **Action Item** All TSC members to review

Discussion around Docker build and whether it should hold up 1.19

**Decision** made that because docker is tech preview if it isn't ready in time for 1.19 then the rest of 1.19 is released, and the docker refresh can wait for 1.20 or be off-cycle.  Once Docker is GA then this would change
