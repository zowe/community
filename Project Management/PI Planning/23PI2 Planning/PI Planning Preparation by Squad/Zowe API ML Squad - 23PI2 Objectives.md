# Zowe API ML Squad - 23PI1 Objectives (Jan 2023 to Apr 2023)

## Identity Federation #2481

* [Identity Federation #2481](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2481)

As a Mainframe user, I want to be able to be correctly routed to the relevant sysplex based on the type of request and also get the information about the existing and available Sysplexes. I also want to be able to synchronize users between distributed Identity providers and ESMs. As a last step I want to make sure that all the authentication related events are properly auditable. 

Plan:
- [Multi-tenancy APIML Deployments #2651](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2651)
- [User profiles federation #2652](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2652)
- [Register API service to multiple clusters #2425](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2425)
- [SPIKE: Central API ML clustering #2666](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2666)
- [apimlAuthenticationToken is overwritten when user works on multiple zowe instances #2636](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2636)
- [As a System Programmer, I want to be able to sync distributed users from file to the ESM for TSS #2761](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2761)
- [As a System Programmer, I want to be able to sync distributed users from file to the ESM for ACF2 #2760](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2760)
- [Publish the Zowe CLI Plugin #2762](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2762)

## As a System Administrator, I need to know about every authentication attempt #2533

If the user is being authenticated against SAF or zOSMF such an attempt is being recorded as the SMF record. This serves for auditing purposes. There are situations when API ML is validating user authentication by API ML issued JWT. This information is currently not recorded in SMF.

As a system administrator, I would like to know about every authentication attempt and I would like to see it in a single place. API ML needs to create SMF record for each authentication with API ML JWT or PAT with details such as timestamp, mainframe identity, and form of the provided authentication(JWT, PAT,...).

- [Issue the SMF record when invalid token is provided, turned on by default #2765](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2765)
- [Issue the SMF record when valid token is provided, turned off by default #2764](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2764)
- [Issue the SMF record when Zowe token is created while mapping certificates #2763](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2763)

## Build Spring Cloud Gateway as a replacement for the current Gateway #2029

* [Build Spring Cloud Gateway as a replacement for the current Gateway #2029](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2029)  
Spring Cloud Zuul is in maintenance mode and not actively developed anymore. Spring Cloud has moved away from the Netflix Zuul OSS and will deprecate it at some point. The official replacement in the Spring Cloud ecosystem is the Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG). On completion of this Epic, the SCG application that will start properly and be able to take responsibility for the current API Gateway with respect to routing and authentication. The authentication functionality itself would remain for now the responsibility of the current API Gateway. The intention is for the SCG to eventually fully replace the existing gateway some point in the future as part of the V3.  

API ML Squad Plan:  
- [Move AT-TLS processing to the Spring Cloud Gateway #2038](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2038)  
- [Support remapping of the x509 authentication #2044](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2044)
- [Support remapping to the SAF token #2045](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2045)

The goal is shared across the whole Zowe and it represents requirements from the Open Mainframe Project. 

* [Get Golden CII Badge](https://github.com/zowe/community/issues/1279)
