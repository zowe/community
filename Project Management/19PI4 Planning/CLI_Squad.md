# CLI Squad - 19PI4 Objectives (September to November, 2019)

- Drive Zowe CLI adoption by building additional functionality into the CICS plugin for Zowe CLI for CICS web services requests.  Specifically, we will add the create action for URIMAP resources.  The objective will be achieved after the requestor validates the functionality to create URIMAP resources.

- Visual Studio Code Repository has had significant adoption:
  15+ contributors, 67 stars, 1,300+ unique installations, 6,000+ total downloads

  We intend to drive further adoption of Zowe by delivering Zowe VS Code Extension version 1.0. As a prerequisite, we will ensure the functionality behaves in an Eclipse Theia environment so that hosted IDEs can provide the extension. The objective will be achieved after the VS Code Extension has a published 1.0 version on the marketplace. Issues to be resolved are listed at https://github.com/zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe/milestone/12. Contributions are welcome! J
