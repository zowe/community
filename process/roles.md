# Zowe project role definitions

This document defines the roles of the Zowe sub-project within the development community. The Zowe sub-project generally has the following roles. It's expected that sub-projects have more specific definition of the roles as it pertains to that sub-project's community.

## Adopters

An "Adopter" uses the frameworks and technology provided by Zowe to extend and craft their own offerings. These offerings can be internal or external. When external, these offerings can be made available either commercially or free of charge.

## Contributor

A "Contributor" is an individual that wishes to contribute code or documentation to Zowe.

All code contributions to Zowe are to be made under the [Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/EPL-2.0.html) and all non-code contributions are to be made under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY-4.0)](https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html) unless otherwise approved by the Open Mainframe Project Governing Board.

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach — [the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) — that the [Linux® Kernel community](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

<code>Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@hisdomain.com></code>

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using <code>git commit -s</code>. You might also want to leverage this [command line tool](https://github.com/coderanger/dco) for automatically adding the signoff message on commits.

## Committer

A "Committer" is an individual who has been given the right to commit code to a sub-project of Zowe. Guidelines for how to commit and the Committer status is defined and approved by each sub-project, and is subject to revocation if the individual is in violation of the Code of Conduct by the ZLC.

Rights and responsibilities of a Committer include, but are not limited to the following:

* Review and merge pull requests into a sub-project's repository(s).
* Track, participate in, and vote on relevant discussions in their associated projects.
* Proactively report problems in the bug tracking system, and annotate problem reports with status information, explanations, clarifications, or requests for more information from the submitter. Committers are responsible for updating problem reports when they have done work related to the problem.
* Be responsive to questions raised about the sub-project on mailing lists and other mediums.

# Lead

A "Project Lead" is an individual elected by the Committers of a given sub-project, who oversees the development done by a sub-project.
