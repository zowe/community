  - individual forms, vs. 1 long form
  - file "completed" forms at the community
  - Support TSC in V2 planning

(3) Goal:  Nurture Community Growth
- Colloborate with with TSC to define Incubator projects Lifecycle (characteristics the contribution should have in order to be considered for Zowe, things to avoid, WIP limits i.e. # per year, life-cycle / length of incubation etc.)  [Note:  Most of this work will be on TSC]


(4) Goal: Transition the Onboarding Backlog To Zenhub [stretch]


Risks:
The Onboarding Squad is still small, we need more members to feel confident about achieving our goals!  Any volunteers?
 

Dependencies:
(1) TSC:  Addressing Issue: Clarify the Zowe Vnext and Vprior compatibility policy #1346
(2) API, CLI, Explorer, Web UI Squads for V2 Conformance Requirements + possibly more (Meet with extenders etc.)
(3) OMP:  Finalizing V2 Conformance program (Badges, Landscape, etc.)
(4) Explorer Squad is dependent on Objective #3 (CICS VS Code Ext  identified as CORE)
