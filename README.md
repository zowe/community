## Zowe Sub-projects

The Zowe community consists of several sub-projects that focus on specific areas of the codebase. Like any open source project, each sub-projects has its own governance structure and release process that aligns with the primary framework guidelines.

Zowe sub-projects have a 3-stage lifecycle of incubation, active and emeritus as described [here](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/stages.md).

### Active

The Zowe Client SDKs offer consistent and language-specific access to REST APIs on z/OS that are integrated with the Zowe API Mediation Layer. Developers will be able to import the appropriate language Zowe Client SDK into their project and avoid the complexities of coding to REST APIs directly.

The Zowe Client SDK incubation sub-project is currently developing SDKs for Node.JS, Swift and Python.

* Research and develop additional "integrated" Zowe release formats, i.e., containers
* Design Zowe Release formats which are maintainable by users - configurable, upgradable/patchable, extensible
* Define how Zowe Extensions install, configure, and upgrade when used with Zowe release formats.
* Work with other squads in ensuring alignment to the above goals - particularly communicating release format requirements

#### Pull Request Guidelines

Pull requests cannot be merged without the approval of at least one maintainer, who will be looking for the pull request to meet requirements as follows:

* The code in the pull request must adhere to the [general Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/zowe/zlc/blob/master/process/CODING_STYLE.md) and those for the sub-project.
* The code must compile/transpile (where applicable) and pass a smoke test such that the code is not known to break the current state of Zowe.
* The pull request must describe the purpose and implementation to the extent that the maintainer understands what is being accomplished. Some pull requests need less details than others depending on novelty.
* The pull request must state how to test this change, if applicable, such that the maintainer or a QA team can check correctness. The explanation may simply be to run included test code.
* If a pull request depends upon a pull request from the same / another repository that is pending, this must be stated such that maintainers know in which order to merge open pull requests.

### Reporting Security Issues

Please direct all security issues to zowe-security@lists.openmainframeproject.org. A member of the security team will reply to acknowledge receipt of the vulnerability and coordinate remediation with the affected project.
