# Zowe API ML Squad - 23PI2 Objectives (May 2023 to July 2023)

## {CONTINUED} Identity Federation #2481

As a Mainframe user, I want to be able to be correctly routed to the relevant sysplex based on the type of request and also get the information about the existing and available Sysplexes. I also want to be able to synchronize users between distributed Identity providers and ESMs.

Plan:
- [Identity Federation #2481](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2481)
- [Multi-tenancy APIML Deployments #2651](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2651)


## {CONTINUED} SMF Records creation #2533

If the user is being authenticated against SAF or zOSMF such an attempt is being recorded as the SMF record. This serves for auditing purposes. There are situations when API ML is validating user authentication by API ML issued JWT. This information is currently not recorded in SMF.

As a system administrator, I would like to know about every authentication attempt and I would like to see it in a single place. API ML needs to create SMF record for each authentication with API ML JWT or PAT with details such as timestamp, mainframe identity, and form of the provided authentication(JWT, PAT,...).

- [Issue the SMF record when invalid token is provided, turned on by default #2765](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2765)
- [Issue the SMF record when valid token is provided, turned off by default #2764](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2764)
- [Issue the SMF record when Zowe token is created while mapping certificates #2763](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2763)

## z/OS V3R1 (3.1) Toleration Support for the API ML on TSS and ACF2 #2881

As a system administrator I want to be able to run the API ML on z/OS 3.1 with the confidence that it will continue to function as expected.    
- Regression Test the API ML on the forthcoming z/OS V3R1Â operating system to verify it continues to function properly.  

**API ML Squad Plan:**  
- [z/OS V3R1 (3.1) Toleration Support for the API ML on TSS and ACF2 #2881](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2881)

## API Catalog UI enhancements and templating #2586

As a system administrator I want to be able to run the API Catalog properly off-platform in a distributed environment such as cloud platform and I want to be able to use our company branding on the portal so it's usage feels natural for the engineers within the company.    
- API Catalog supports templating so that it can be branded and themed according to user preferences  

As a system programmer or application developer, I want to have one easy place to see all the APIs available within the company with great examples of how to use them. 
- API Catalog contains UI enhancements

**API ML Squad Plan:**

- [API Developer Portal #2586](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2586)

## Improve logging for the API ML #1796

Zowe will enhance the support experience of Zowe with the aim to reduce the number of support cases opened. Where cases are opened this objective will reduce time taken to identify defects' root causes and more quickly address configuration problems.  

In the default setup, if there is no issue, we should log only that the services started, ideally including a point when the whole Zowe is started and works properly. 
In the default setup, if there are issues that limit the functionality but don't break things, we need to log them as warnings in a way that's actionable by the users. In the default setup, if there are issues preventing Zowe from working, these will be logged as errors with easy to find error codes and actionable text.  
Logs created for debugging should go to files instead of the spool so that the diagnostics pax contains them.  
Debugging logs should contain, by default, the details of the TLS communication. 

**Problems to solve:**

- With current tooling, it's difficult for Zowe users to understand what's wrong and resolve the problem themselves without needing external help
- For L1 support it's difficult to retrieve the information about the system from the user

**API ML Squad plan:**  

- [Easier debugging of swagger doc rendering](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2315)  
- [Do not log the full stracktrace for common errors #2614](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2614)  
- [Log meaningful messages when debugging API ML #2892](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2892)  


## {Stretch} Better Observability of onboarded services via Open Telemetry

We want to explore the option of introducing the Open Telemetry into the Zowe API Mediation Layer. As a part of the overall
Observability approach we are also considering to deprecate and then archive the metrics service.  

[(SPIKE) Support for Open Telemetry #2865](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2865)

## Zowe / api-layer backlog management

- [The certificate management documentation depends on V1 tooling unavailable in V2 #2823](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2823)
- [Confusing documentation for security configuration of OIDC and x509 features #2873](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2873)
- [ZSS may not accept JWT #2878](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2878)
- [Network error from API Catalog on system with Java 11 #2677](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2677)
