# Support

The Zowe project doesn't provide any guarantees with respect to Support. If you need any guarantees, please reach out to one of the Zowe Conformant Support Provider. 

This document outlines our learnings and tools around the Support provided as-is by the Zowe Community. 

## Information Sharing

The primary ways to share the information are:
- GitHub Issues
- OpenMainframeProject's Slack Messages

In case the information are non-public in the nature and larger than what's possible to share through the Slack, it's possible to use the project's Google Drive to store temporary files necessary for solving the case. The TSC Directory contains sub directory Logs - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QeKz5jxESo7QXxd6_MxJa_KGKejUzPJR?usp=drive_link 

For a new case create new directory with name in form RepositoryName_IssueNumber (e.g. api-layer_3845). Once the issue is closed, delete the directory. 

### Information management

The cases that doesn't have any activity in 90 days will be deleted every year, if they aren't deleted when the case is solved.
