# Zowe CLI / Zowe SDK Roadmap

## Support connections to multiple APIML gateways through profile linking
- What problem are you solving?
  - Users cannot use team config to access services behind multiple APIML gateways.
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Allow users to optionally specify explicit profile links in team configs - initially to link a service profile to a base (APIML) profile, so that Zowe CLI and Zowe Explorer can identify which APIML connection to use for a given service profile.
- When do you plan to start the work?
  - **CY24Q2**
- When do you plan to deliver the solution?
  - **CY24Q2**

## Searching
- What problem are you solving?
  - Users are not able to easily locate a data set, member, or spool file that contains information that they are looking for.
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Give users the ability to search data sets, PDS members, or spool files for a given string, returning a list of files that contain the string and line numbers for each occurrence of the string in the file.
- When do you plan to start the work?
  - **CY24Q1**
- When do you plan to deliver the solution?
  - **CY24Q2**

## Zowe client software event notification system
- What problem are you solving?
  - The Zowe client software (Zowe CLI, Zowe Client SDKs, Zowe Explorer for VS Code, and Zowe Explorer for IntelliJ) have no way of knowing what actions the user has taken in other Zowe Client software (e.g., if the user changes a password in Zowe CLI, Zowe Explorer for VS Code will not know to reload the credentials from disk).
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Implement a system for sharing event notifications (such as a user updating a password) that can be shared by all Zowe Client software regardless of programming language or runtime environment.
- When do you plan to start the work?
  - **CY24Q1**
- When do you plan to deliver the solution?
  - **CY24Q2**

## SDK Conformance and LTS Status
- What problem are you solving?
  - Mainframe developers are interested in extending the existing SDKs in order to create applications for their services
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Solidify the SDK Conformance guidelines for:
    - New Services (like CICS SDK)
    - New Programming languages (like Kotlin SDK)
  - Prepare the SDKs technically and logistically for conformance
  - Determine if existing SDKs are conformant and communicate conformance gaps for prioritization
  - Release the Zowe Client Node.js SDK as LTS
- When do you plan to start the work?
  - **CY23Q2**
- When do you plan to deliver the solution?
  - **CY23Q4** (delayed until CY24Q2)

## Gold OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (Formerly CII Best Practices Badge)
- What problem are you solving?
  - The Zowe Project has not earned the gold OpenSSF Best Practices Badge, a requirement from LF/OMP that ensures the Open-Source project satisfies FLOSS (Free/Libre & Open-Source Software) [Best Practices criteria](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria)
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Review requirements and take necessary actions to satisfy them for the gold badge level 
- When do you plan to start the work?
  - **CY22Q3**
- When do you plan to deliver the solution?
  - **CY24Q1** Achieve Passing Badge (delayed until CY24Q2)
  - **CY24Q4** Achieve Silver Badge
  - **CY25Q4** Achieve Gold Badge

## (Completed) Ensure that Zowe VS Code Extensions can Share Access to zowe.schema.json with Zowe CLI
- What problem are you solving?
  - Zowe CLI overwrites team config profile entries contributed by Zowe Explorer extensions, preventing those extensions from being able to properly access profiles from a user's team config.
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Schema profile additions will be synchronized in such a way that both VS Code extensions and Zowe CLI plug-ins can contribute to a schema without removing the profiles contributed by the other.

  - **CY24Q1**
