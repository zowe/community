# Zowe CLI / Zowe SDK Roadmap

## Ensure that Zowe VS Code Extensions can Share Access to zowe.schema.json with Zowe CLI
- _What problem are you solving?_
  - Zowe CLI overwrites team config profile entries contributed by Zowe Explorer extensions, preventing those extensions from being able to properly access profiles from a user's team config.
- _What are you doing to solve it?_
  - Schema profile additions will be synchronized in such a way that both VS Code extensions and Zowe CLI plug-ins can contribute to a schema without removing the profiles contributed by the other.
- _When do you plan to start the work?_
  - **CY23Q4**
- _When do you plan to deliver the solution?_
  - **CY24Q1** 

## Gold OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (Formerly CII Best Practices Badge)
- _What problem are you solving?_
  - The Zowe Project has not earned the gold OpenSSF Best Practices Badge, a requirement from LF/OMP that ensures the Open Source project satisfies FLOSS (Free/Libre & Open Source Software) [Best Practices criteria](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/criteria)
- _What are you doing to solve it?_
  - Review requirements and take necessary actions to satisfy them for the gold badge level 
- _When do you plan to start the work?_
  - **CY22Q3**
- _When do you plan to deliver the solution?_
  - **CY24Q1** Achieve Passing Badge
  - **CY24Q4** Achieve Silver Badge
  - **CY25Q4** Achieve Gold Badge

## SDK Conformance and LTS Status
- _What problem are you solving?_
  - Mainframe developers are interested in extending the existing SDKs in order to create applications for their services
- _What are you doing to solve it?_
  - Solidify the SDK Conformance guidelines for:
    - New Services (like CICS SDK)
    - New Programming languages (like Kotlin SDK)
  - Prepare the SDKs technically and logistically for conformance
  - Determine if existing SDKs are conformant and communicate conformance gaps for prioritization
  - Release the Zowe Client Node.js SDK as LTS
- _When do you plan to start the work?_
  - **CY23Q2**
- _When do you plan to deliver the solution?_
  - **CY23Q4** (delayed until CY24Q2)
