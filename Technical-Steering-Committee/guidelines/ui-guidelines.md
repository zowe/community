This style guide is the visual language that represents Zowe. It is a living document that will be updated based on the needs of our users and software requirements.

# Principles

* Clear - Our users rely on our software to help them be efficient in their work. The interfaces and experiences we design should be clear so there is never any confusion about where users should click or how to take the next step. Users should always feel confident in their actions.
* Consistent - Users should be able to look at Zowe software products and know they are in a family. Each software product is different but should use similar patterns, icons, and interactions. If a user is switching to a new product within Zowe it should feel familiar.
* Smart - Our users are smart and they need smart software. Zowe design patterns should always compliment the user’s intelligence and reflect the user’s complex work environment. Designs should align with Zowe's Design Language by putting the human needs of the user first.
 
# Color

Color brings a design to life. Color is versatile; it's used to express emotion and tone, as well as place emphasis and create associations. Color should always be used in meaningful and intentional ways in order to create patterns and visual cues.

## Color palette
The Zowe color palette is designed and implemented in a them-able manner. The universal color variables are determined by common roles and usage; it is not based singularly on a color value (i.e. unique hex code). The same color value may be assigned to multiple variables in a theme's palette when the values have distinctly different roles.

A universal variable can also have multiple associated roles when the color is consistently used across those roles. This allows for uniform color application across themes while giving each theme the freedom to express its own individuality at a more detailed level.

## Color contrast | WCAG AA standards

All type color combinations on Zowe must pass WCAG AA standards of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. For larger text, if the font weight is light (300) or normal (400) the text should be no smaller than 24px. If the font weight is Semi-Bold (600) then the large text should be no smaller than 19px.

Body Text (4.5:1)

Large Text (3:1): at least 24px / 19px semi-bold

# Typography

Typography is used to create clear hierarchies, useful organizations, and purposeful alignments that guide users through the product and experience. It is the core structure of any well designed interface.

Body typeface: Roboto
Title typeface: Roboto Condensed

Sample:

## Font weight

Font weight is an important typographic style that can add emphasis and is used to differentiate content hierarchy. Font weight and size pairings must be carefully balanced. A bold weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight font of the same size. However, a lighter weight font can rank hierarchically higher than a bold font if the lighter weight type size is significantly larger than the bold.

Roboto font family provides a wide range of weights. However, only SemiBold, Regular, Light should be used for product design.

 
Font-weight: 300 / Light

![Light Type Sample](images/type_light_sample.png "Light Type Sample")

Should only be used at sizes greater than or equal to 18px / 1.125rem

Font-weight: 400 / Normal

![Regular Type Sample](images/type_regular_sample.png "RegularType Sample")

Font-weight: 500 / Semi-bold

![Bold Type Sample](images/type_bold_sample.png "Bold Type Sample")

## Body copy

We recommend using two sizes for body copy. The first is UI specific. To maximize screen real estate we chose a smaller 14px / 0.875rem body copy size for the standard UI console. However, for areas that have prolonged reading, like Documentation, we use a larger body copy size of 16px / 1rem to enhance readability.
 
## Line Scale

1.2 Minor Third type scale - mobile

![Type Scale Mobile](images/type_scale_mobile-1024x461.png "Type Scale Mobile")
 
## Line-height

Line-height, traditionally known as leading, is one of several factors that directly contribute to readability and pacing of copy. Line-heights are based on the size of the font itself. Ideal line-heights for standard copy have a ratio of 1:1.5 (typesize : line-height). For example, a type at 16px/1rem would have a line-height of 1.5rem/24px (16 x 1.5). The exception to this rule are headings, which need less spacing and therefore have a line-height ratio of 1:1.25.
 
## Embed Font

To embed your selected fonts into a webpage, copy this code into the <head> of your HTML document.

Standard:
```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed|Roboto:300,400,500" rel="stylesheet">
```

Import:
```
<style>
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed|Roboto:300,400,500');
</style>
```
Specify in CSS

Use the following CSS rules to specify these families:
```
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif;
```

# Grid

Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Zowe uses a responsive, mobile first, fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or view port size increases.

## 12 Column Grid
A 12 column grid is simply best practice. 12 is a well-distributed division as you have a good range of widths you can assign to content. It is a straight number, it is dividable by 2, 3, 4 and 6 so it allows enough flexibility. Many frameworks like Bootstrap and Pure use a 12 column grid as their default. Other grid systems like a 5 column grid can reduce flexibility, balance, and consistency.

## Gutters
Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) through padding. For devices with a screen width greater than 768px, the column padding is 20px. For devices with a screen width less than 768px, the column padding is 10px.

Screen width ≥ 768px = 20px gutters

Screen width 768px = 10px gutters
 
## Columns
Zowe designs should be limited to twelve columns. If designers feel that they need fewer columns in their grid, they can specify the number of twelve available columns they wish to span.

This can translate to percentages of the twelve columns. Using this method, a designer can create a folded, less granular grid. For example, if your component spans three equal columns, that is equal to 25% of twelve columns.

Column count: 12 _

## Margins
The twelve column grid does not have a maximum width. It has a width of 100%, with built in margins that create padding between column count and the edges of the viewport.

In devices with a screen width greater than 768px, the margins are 5% on the left, and 5% on the right.

In devices with a screen width less than 768px, the margins are 3% on the left, and 3% on the right.

Example: Screen Width  > 768px

5% left = 38px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)
5% right = 38px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)
12 columns + gutters = 768px - 38px - 38px = 692px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)
 
![Grid Desktop](images/grid_desktop.png "Grid Desktop")

Example: Screen Width 320px

3% left = 10px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)
3% right = 10px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)
12 columns + gutters = 320px - 10px - 10px = 300px (rounded to nearest whole pixel)

# Icons

Icons are key component for a successful UI design because they are a visual way to help add meaning to elements.

Zowe leverages [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) which is license compatible with the Zowe project

## General guidelines

Embrace simplicity. Use a simple unique shape or element that represents the essence of the app. Avoid excessive details and redundant shading.

Use the Zowe color palette. Avoid using a monochromatic palette for your iconsUse the Zowe color palette to ensure that the icons have a consistent look.

Use unique shapes and design elements. Avoid using single commonly used design elements, such as the gear, document, and folder. These elements can reduce recognizability. Don’t use photos and screenshots. Keep icons simple and abstract.

Avoid labels and text. Short, commonly used abbreviations are acceptable, if necessary. Remember that all icons have center-aligned labels beneath them.

Use brand identity. If your Zowe application has a brand identity element such as a logo, you can use it. Don’t forget to include the copyright symbol.

## Shape, size, and composition

Use a flat design style. Flat design focuses on open space, bright colors, and flat graphics or illustrations. This minimalistic design approach puts the emphasis on usability

![icon_sample1](images/icon_sample1.png "icon_sample1")

A flat icon has clean, crisp edges and a flat dimensional layout.

Use solid fill shapes. Most Zowe App icons have solid fill shapes, which are more readable on dark backgrounds.

Use the circle shape as the background application icons.
Set the outer corners to 100% opacity. Create an image file that is 87x87 pixels, and save the file in PNG format.

Maintain consistent visual proportions

![icon_sample2](images/icon_sample2.png "icon_sample2")

## Colors and shades
Verify the contrast.
Verify that the background color of the icon provides enough contrast against the desktop.

![icon_sample3](images/icon_sample3.png "icon_sample3")

## Use the Zowe palette.
To ensure that your app icons are clear and consistent, use the Zowe palette.
If you need to use well-established brand identity elements, you can use the colors that are associated with the brand.

## Layer Shadows
Use smooth shadows to represent that some elements are on different layers and should be visually separated.Avoid using too many layers because they can overcomplicate the icon.

![icon_sample4](images/icon_sample4.png "icon_sample4")

Use the long shadow for consistency. Although the long shadow effect doesn’t have any semantic meaning, , it adds focus to the main icon shape and identifies the central ,most meaningful element.

Use the gradient shadow settings shown in the following image, or use a flat non-gradient shadow with 20% opacity and #000000 color.
