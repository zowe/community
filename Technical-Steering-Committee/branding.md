# Branding 

This policy builds upon and extends the [Linux Foundation trademark policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage) and [Open Mainframe Project's Branding guidelines](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/branding-guidelines).

All the projects by default use the Zowe logo and imagery approved by TSC. The projects don't create derivatives
or use custom logos other than the Zowe one. The approved imagery is available in the [Open Mainframe Project's artwork](https://artwork.openmainframeproject.org/projects/zowe/) and on the [Artwork's GitHub repository](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork/tree/main/projects/zowe).

It's possible to ask for an exception. The TSC needs to approve the exception and the derived work
needs to be created by or consulted with the Linux Foundation [art team](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork).
