# Zowe ZOS Squad 22PI2 Planning

## Security 

Security assurance will come from using tools that analyze the code to index vulnerability databases and note non-best-practice use of library functions and memory allocation.  To be able to use these tools, the codebase needs to compile off-ZOS.   A stretch goal is to be able to use "sanitizers".  (https://github.com/google/sanitizers) and valgrind in our CICD pipeline.  

## Static Analysis

A number of tools were reviewed, and any that were pattern-based produced far too many false positives.  The Clang/LLVM community provides some of the best static analysis tools.   These tools are far more accurate, and are based on the compiler that we are moving too.  They are also free!

## Clang Readiness

The IBM Toronto Compilers team has strongly indicated their direction is Clang.  (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/xl-c-and-cpp-aix/16.1?topic=new-clang-based-front-end).   The hybrid xlclang compiler is in use for some files in Zowe 2.0, and will probably replace xlc completely over 2.x, except for the "Metal C" Compilation.   

## Cross Platform Compilation

The zowe-common-c repo could compile, and in many cases run, on Lunix, AIX, and Windows in 2018.  Over past few years a number of commits were made that broke cross-platform compilation.  

## Automated Testing

There is a growing set of tests under zowe-common-c/tests.

## OSS Usage and Compatibility

The availability of xlclang has started to allow the easier use of open-source on ZOS.  Yaml handling, and embedded JS scripting are provided though OSS tools in 2.0, and I assume more libraries will come in as 2.x progessses.  

## Community Support

The Configuration Manager supports the system and webui squad with yaml and json-schema services.   Streth goals include general SMF support and Subsystem Interface Support for the Zebra and Explorer projects.

## "Single-user Zowe"

A demo-ed capablity that allows a zero-config ZSS server run should be completed shortly.  

## Education

These repos are some of the most complex and sophisticated examples of C coding for ZOS.   It would be good to have an office hours or regular set of webinars to teach people how to be effective C programmers for ZOS.
