# Branding 

All the projects by default use the default Zowe logo and imagery. The projects don't create derivatives
or use custom logos other than the Zowe one. 

It's possible to ask for an exception. The TSC needs to approve the exception and the derived work
needs to be created by or consulted with the Linux Foundation [art team](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork).
