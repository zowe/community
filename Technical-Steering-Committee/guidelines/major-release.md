# Vnext guidelines

The preparation for Vnext starts two PIs (half a year) before the actual GA date. The GA date
is expected to be aligned with an end of a PI. 

## Key Milestones

Let's assume we will have release on the end of 24PI1. This would mean that the preparation for the major 
release will start with 23PI4 and continue through 24PI1.  

- PI - 2 (Approximately 270 days before the release, In an example this means 23PI3)
- PI - 1 (Approximately 180 days before the release, In an example this means 23PI4)
- Release PI (Approximately 90 days before release, In an example this means 24PI1)
- Day 0 represents the GA date for the release
