# Zowe Web UI - 24PI2 - (2024/04/29 - 2024/07/22)

# In-squad tasks

## Ivy-based Desktop [#1015](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/1015)
**Priority**: 1

**Description**: To move on from ViewEngine, research in this PI will focus upon changes to the Desktop for loading plugins via Ivy methods. Initial R&D will center upon webpack changes for Ivy compilation and of use of ECMAScript Module loading of Components/Modules. The task will cover both the Desktop and how Apps will load into it, but does not cover the fan-out of upgrading every App. App upgrades and any consequences of moving to an Ivy based Module loading system will be tracked in new epics as needed.

# Stretch


## ZEN [#16](https://github.com/zowe/zen/issues/16)
**Priority**: 2

**Description**: The webUI squad will be contributing to the upcoming Zowe server install wizard project ZEN, and has identified several tasks to be done within https://github.com/zowe/zen/issues and in particular hope to accomplish https://github.com/zowe/zen/issues/16 within the first PI, or at least first release.
