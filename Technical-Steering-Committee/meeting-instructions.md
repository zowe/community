## Running meeting

The first part of the meeting is about quick synchronization on what different squads did. This usually 
takes approximately 15 minutes with squad leads presenting the key updates in the last week. 

Afterwards go through the planned topics and if there is a bit of time ask whether there is any other 
topic to be discussed. 

## After the meeting

Prepare the meeting minutes in the [https://github.com/zowe/community/tree/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/meetings](https://github.com/zowe/community/tree/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/meetings)
to the appropriate year. 

The meeting minutes should mainly containt the overall discussed topics, recordings and presentations. 
There is no need to go into too much detail.
