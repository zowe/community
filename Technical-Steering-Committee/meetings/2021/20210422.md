## Mentorships

- The next step is to collect projects and mentors
- Afterwards the mentors will select the mentees (Leanid will explain the process)
- Meanwhile the TSC will order and rank the projects

## Governance

- The current direction is good, after finalising text ready for vote

## Contributors

- Concerns around the distinction between the committers and people who can write into repository
- How do we work with recognized members who aren't coding?
- In general good direction but work to do
