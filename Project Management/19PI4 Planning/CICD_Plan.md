* Objectives:
    - Support CUPIDs to drive install/configuration improvements
    - Increase Test Coverage in open community
        - System, Functional
    - Streamline build pipelines in open infrastructure to enhance code re-use and to share common functionalities (sonar, system test, deployment, swagger, etc.)
        - Driving shared pipeline adoption
        - Merging select repositories (zlux, explorer, pax+)
        - Better Docker Image management
    - Improve some project-wide automation
    - Begin Performance Testing Framework
        - ...So that we can communicate expected performance for Zowe components
        - Test cases will probably written outside CI/CD squad

* Risks:
  - This was our first attempted PI Planning, so there are meaningful gaps in process
    - We did not size our work issues for this PI
    - Not all runway is in place, some issues may be bigger than expected
  - Limited capacity and frequent disruptions
    - There are some other interested developer and teams who may be able to pick up work ad-hoc
  - Dependent on Infrastructure from third parties - we do not have complete autonomy and limitations may appear
  - Some internal procedural syncronization may introduce delays


* Note:
  - All of the work we have planned is available in the `zowe-install-packaging` issues backlog, under the `Zowe CI/CD Super Epic` epic. There are currently 78 stories, all created and discussed within the last 2 weeks!
