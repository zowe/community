# Zowe API ML Squad - 23PI3 Objectives  
(August 2023 to October 2023)


## API ML in multi-domain / multi-tenant deployments #2651

As a Mainframe user, I want to be able to be correctly routed to the relevant sysplex based on the type of request and also get the information about the existing and available Sysplexes. I also want to be able to synchronize users between distributed Identity providers and ESMs.  

Impact on other Zowe components: NONE

## V3 Build Spring Cloud Gateway as a replacement for the current Gateway #2029

Spring Cloud Zuul is in maintenance mode and not actively developed anymore. Spring Cloud has moved away from the Netflix Zuul OSS and will deprecate it at some point. The official replacement in the Spring Cloud ecosystem is the Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG). On completion of this Epic, the SCG application that will start properly and be able to take responsibility for the current API Gateway with respect to routing and authentication. The intention is for the SCG to fully replace the existing gateway with the release of V3.  

Impact on other Zowe components: POSSIBLE

## Improve logging for the API ML #1796

Zowe will enhance the support experience of Zowe with the aim to reduce the number of support cases opened. Where cases are opened this objective will reduce time taken to identify defects' root causes and more quickly address configuration problems.  

- if there is no issue, we should log only that the services started, ideally including a point when the whole Zowe is started and works properly. 
- if there are issues that limit the functionality but don't break things, we need to log them as warnings in a way that's actionable by the users.  
- if there are issues preventing Zowe from working, these will be logged as errors with easy to find error codes and actionable text.  
- Logs created for debugging should go to files instead of the spool so that the diagnostics pax contains them.  
- Debugging logs should contain, by default, the details of the TLS communication.

## Roadmap

### Multi-Tenancy API ML Deployments

- What problem are you solving?
  - Authenticating Zowe users across Sysplex and security domains 
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Route users to the relevant sysplex based on the type of request and retrieve data on existing and available Sysplexes
- When do you plan to start the work?
  - 23PI3
- When do you plan to deliver the solution?
  - 23PI3

### API Catalog UI enhancements and templating

- What problem are you solving?
  - Adopters want to have easy access to the available APIs and easily find what they need. This includes their own internal APIs.
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - Update API Catalog, simplify deployment and support wider amount of ways to show the information about APIs

### V3 Support Java 17

- What problem are you solving?
  - API ML depends heavily on the spring framework. Spring 6 drops support for java versions prior to 17. 
- What are you doing to solve it?
  - API ML should reflect this and be able to compile and run on java 17. The objective for the API ML is to use java 17 in the toolchain and produce artifacts that run on this runtime.
