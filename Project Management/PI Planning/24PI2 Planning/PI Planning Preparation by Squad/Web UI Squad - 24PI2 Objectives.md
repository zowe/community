# Zowe Web UI - 24PI1 - (2024/04/29 - 2024/07/22)

# In-squad tasks

## Ivy-based Desktop
**Priority**: 1

**Description**: To move on from ViewEngine, research in this PI will focus upon changes to the Desktop for loading plugins via Ivy methods. Initial R&D will center upon webpack changes for Ivy compilation and of use of ECMAScript Module loading of Components/Modules. The task will cover both the Desktop and how Apps will load into it.


## Angular/Webpack upgrades [#975](https://github.com/zowe/zlux/issues/975)
**Priority**: 2

**Description**: In preparation for Zowe v3, library upgrades should be done to keep within the maintenance window of important libraries that we use that we cannot otherwise change mid-release. In particular, Angular and webpack are such libraries and newer versions exist than we currently use. We will work on upgrading them as much as possible.


# Stretch
