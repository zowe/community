### Tracking of the blog pipeline and publication progress

- The pipeline of blogs for the [Zowe Medium Blog Site](https://medium.com/zowe) is available for viewing on a publicly accessible [KanBan board](https://github.com/orgs/openmainframeproject/projects/4).  This allows anyone to see what articles are being worked on by others prior to publication, and also for a blog author it let you see the status of your blog being edited as well as the assigned reviewers.  

## Blog preparation

**Blogs should:**

 - Be brief (generally < 1200; > 500 words)
 - Focus on a target audience
 - Be relevant
   - The title and first paragraph should compel the viewer to take the time to read the piece.  The content should be relevant and helpful for the target audience.
 - Leverage visuals (screenshots, GIFs, etc.), especially an eye-catching featured image  
   - See public, license-free sites like unsplash.com

**Discoverability (search results):**

 - Determine which Google search keywords are best suited for your content and target audience (i.e., what are you communicating and to whom?  What keywords are they likely to use?).  Include these keywords in your title and related words in the body, especially the first paragraph.

 - Be sure your title, opening paragraph (and featured image) will stand out in a search by your target audience (i.e., will it get people to click your entry over all the other Google results?)

## Publishing steps

 - Create a Medium handle.  
 - Let [zowe-blog-editors@openmainframeproject.org](email:zowe-blog-editors@openmainframeproject.org) know your handle so you can be added as a “writer” for the publication.  To see your handle, select your profile picture when you log into medium.com, it will begin with an `@` symbol, e.g. `@myusername_1974.  

### When ready to write

 - Go to the Zowe blog [KanBan board](https://github.com/orgs/openmainframeproject/projects/4) to see what other blogs are being worked on in case there is a blog already being authored/prepared on the same topic.  See also [Tracking of blogs](#tracking-of-the-blog-pipeline-and-publication-progress)
 - Go to [Medium.com](https://medium.com)
 - Click your profile (should be logged in)
 - Click New Story

### Writing your blog

 - Begin editing
 - If needed, save as “draft”
 - Include the following sentences at the end of your blog, shown below as it should appear.  
 - "If you enjoyed this blog checkout more [Zowe blogs here](https://medium.com/zowe). Or, ask a question and join the conversation on the [Open Mainframe Project Slack Channel](https://openmainframeproeject.slack.org) #Zowe-dev, #Zowe-user or #Zowe-onboarding. If this is your first time using the OMP slack channel register [here](https://slack.openmainframeproject.org)."
   ```
   Raw markdown for the slack channel paragraph:

   ```

**Please do not publish your own post.**

### Include OMP Branding

 - At the first mention of Zowe use the branding phrase `Open Mainframe Project's Zowe`  with hyperlinks to https://www.openmainframeproject.org/ and https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/zowe.  An example of this is the sentence below as it should appear in the blog.
 - "This blog describes how to obtain and install The [Open Mainfranme Project's](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) [Zowe](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/zowe) command line interface."
   ```
   Raw markdown for the OMP branding example:
   
   This blog describes how to obtain and install The [Open Mainfranme Project's](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/) [Zowe](https://www.openmainframeproject.org/all-projects/zowe) command line interface.  
   ```

**Please do not publish your own post.**

### When ready to publish

 - You may need to add the publication to your profile (Profile => Publication => New Publication)
 - Double check: be sure you have...
   - compelling title and opening paragraph (discoverability is critical!)
   - featured image and visuals in place.  By default, the first image will be associated with the blog post, however you can choose to use a different headline image by navigating to the image while in edit mode, select it manually, and press `Shift + F`. 
   - appropriate links and tags
 - Include 4 tags like: `Zowe`, `Mainframe`, `DevOps`, `Open Source`, [specific technology like `COBOL`, `VSCode`], [specific roles like `Sysprog`], etc.  There are 5 tags allowed per article, and one of them must be used to categorize the blog as `Zowecore`, `Zoweincubation` or `Zoweecosystem`.  See [Zowe Core](#zowe-core), [Zowe Ecosystem](#zowe-ecosytstem), and [Zowe Incubation](#zowe-incubation).

 ## Content guidelines

 As a blog writer you can write about any topic that you're interested in and that will provide value to the Zowe community. The content on our blog consists of:

 - Articles about core Zowe projects, Zowe incubation projects, or Zowe conformant offerings
 - Technical content and how-to's
 - Stories about Zowe deployments
 - Use cases and success stories
 - Reports from Zowe events

 Other topics are welcome, but it needs to have a direct link to the Zowe community
 
 Blogs fall into one of three categories and are differentiated to avoid a user visiting a Zowe blogsite from misunderstanding the relationship between whether the content being described is free open source software included with a Long Term Support (LTS) Zowe release, a commercial vendor Zowe offerings, or a project in its incubation phase.

 Posts are vendor-neutral, although the author is allowed to describe their bio in relation to their role at a commercial company, (e.g. Janet is lead systems programmer at mainframewidgets.com), including links to social media handles.

## Personas
 
 The Zowe community is made up of a number of different personas

 - **Users**.  
   - Mainframers who are using Zowe technology, covering its components Zowe Explorer, Zowe desktop, API Mediation Layer or Command Line Interface.  This includes developers, system programmers, devops pipeline engineers, ...
 - **Administrators**.  
   - Mainframers who are concerned with installing, configuring, tuning, managing Zowe distributions on behalf of users.
 - **Architects**.  
   - Software architects interested in articles that cover broad topics relates to positioning Zowe rather than end user articles.  Architectural blogs will likely have a higher content of diagrams and background, whereas a user article might have more screen shots and hands on code-snippets.

To help blog readers navigate between posts for different personas, there are specific sections titled `For Users`, `For Administrators` and `For Architects`.  The persona will be applied by the editors reviewing and accepting the blog content, although a writer may indicate when they submit a blogpost which persona they have in mind their audience.
