Risks:
The Onboarding Squad is still small, we need more members to feel confident about achieving our goals!  Any volunteers?
 

Dependencies:
(1) API, CLI, Explorer, Web UI Squads for V2 Conformance Requirements + possibly more (Meet with extenders etc.)
(2) OMP:  Finalizing V2 Conformance program (Badges, Landscape, etc.)
