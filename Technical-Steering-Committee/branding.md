# Branding 

All projects must use the [standard Zowe logo](https://artwork.openmainframeproject.org/projects/zowe/) ([github source](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork/tree/main/projects/zowe)) and imagery approved by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), Open Mainframe Project, and Linux Foundation. Projects must not create derivatives or custom logos except when granted through an exception by the TSC. Such exception will be granted in cooperation with the Linux Foundation [art team](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/artwork).
